# docker-boilerplates

## Overview

This repo is simply a compilation of different docker compose files that I have compiled over the past couple years. When I try out a new application on my server I always deploy them in the same way. Docker Compose and persistent storage in a folder on my main user's home folder. Every one of these compose files is created with this in mind and I have deployed all of these apps myself so I know these work. Before deploying using any of these you should always check the compose file as I have changed passwords and secrets in each to something generic. Also, reading the app in question's documentation is still needed to see how things should be configured. Some of these apps require .env files. These are not included. 

## Licensing

There is none. Do anything you want with any of these. 

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute with Pull requests! I know I certainly haven't deployed everything! If you have compose files with the same processes in mind I would love to compile them into this project!
